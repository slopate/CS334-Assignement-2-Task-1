# CS334-Assignement-2-Task-1

This is python code to test the functionality of a sensor, joystick, and button connected to a rasberry Pi.
There are 3 modes of operation which can be cycled though by the switch. They each post different output to the command line.
This code requires the "termcolor" python library, which can be installed with the command "pip install termcolor".
